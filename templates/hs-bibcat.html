<p class="lead">In the preliminary stages of a
functional programming project for BIBCAT being developed in 
<a href="{{ url_for('slide', page='glossary') }}#haskell">Haskell</a>.
The inspiration for this work is the <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>
project by John MacFarlane that allows you take different document formats such
as docx, markdown, html, epub and convert them into other formats including 
PDF, docx, markdown, epub, and markdown among others.

<ul class="lead">
    <li>Haskell has strong graph data structure support built into the
    language, much of what we're attempt to do with BIBCAT is at a high-level
    graph manipulation and translation between different graphs. Moving 
    towards a pure graph implementation will hopefully simplify and speed-up
    some of the operations in BIBCAT</li>
    <li>Haskell programs can be complied that along with its graph support,
    should provide a significant speed boost to the ingester processing from
    different metadata formats to BIBFRAME and Schema.org RDF</li>
    <li>Haskell has influenced important features of Python including
    <em>decorators</em> and now with the release of Python 3.6, Python
    now has optional typing that is very similar to Haskell's strong 
    typing support.</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">The Catalog Pull Platform has two active Haskell projects:</p>
<ul class="lead">
    <li>A fork of abandoned project on Google Code, the hsmarc project available at 
    <a href="https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/hsmarc">https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/hsmarc</a> 
    provides operations on MARC21 records.</li>
    <li>The bibcaths project, available at <a href="https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/bibcat-hs">https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/bibcat-hs</a> 
    is still in it's infancy but the features set will initially include support for converting
    MARC21, XML, and CSV into BIBFRAME RDF using the same RDF Rules used in the BIBCAT project.
    </li>
</ul>
